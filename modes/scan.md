# Mode: scan — Portal Scanner (Job Discovery)

Scan configured job portals, filter by title relevance, and add new postings to the pipeline for later evaluation.

> **Note (v1.5+):** The default scanner (`scan.mjs` / `npm run scan`) is **zero-token** and only queries the public Greenhouse, Ashby, and Lever APIs directly. The Playwright/WebSearch tiers described below are the **agent** flow (run by Claude/Codex), not what `scan.mjs` does. If a company has no Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever API, `scan.mjs` will ignore it; for those cases, the agent must manually complete Tier 1 (Playwright) or Tier 3 (WebSearch).

## Recommended execution

Run as a subagent to avoid consuming the main context:

```
Agent(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="[contents of this file + specific data]",
    run_in_background=True
)
```

## Configuration

Read `portals.yml`, which contains:
- `search_queries`: List of WebSearch queries with `site:` filters per portal (broad discovery)
- `tracked_companies`: Specific companies with `careers_url` for direct navigation
- `title_filter`: positive/negative/seniority_boost keywords for title filtering

## Discovery strategy (3 tiers)

### Tier 1 — Direct Playwright (PRIMARY)

**For each company in `tracked_companies`:** Navigate to its `careers_url` with Playwright (`browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`), read ALL visible job listings, and extract title + URL from each. This is the most reliable method because:
- It sees the page in real time (not cached Google results)
- It works with SPAs (Ashby, Lever, Workday)
- It detects new postings instantly
- It does not depend on Google indexing

**Every company MUST have `careers_url` in portals.yml.** If it does not, look it up once, save it, and use it in future scans.

### Tier 2 — ATS APIs / Feeds (COMPLEMENTARY)

For companies with a public API or structured feed, use the JSON/XML response as a fast complement to Tier 1. It is faster than Playwright and reduces visual scraping errors.

**Current support (variables inside `{}`):**
- **Greenhouse**: `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{company}/jobs`
- **Ashby**: `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR**: list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; posting detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Lever**: `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor**: `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday**: `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**Parsing convention by provider:**
- `greenhouse`: `jobs[]` → `title`, `absolute_url`
- `ashby`: GraphQL `ApiJobBoardWithTeams` with `organizationHostedJobsPageName={company}` → `jobBoard.jobPostings[]` (`title`, `id`; build public URL if not present in payload)
- `bamboohr`: list `result[]` → `jobOpeningName`, `id`; build detail URL `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`; to read the full JD, GET the detail and use `result.jobOpening` (`jobOpeningName`, `description`, `datePosted`, `minimumExperience`, `compensation`, `jobOpeningShareUrl`)
- `lever`: root array `[]` → `text`, `hostedUrl` (fallback: `applyUrl`)
- `teamtailor`: RSS items → `title`, `link`
- `workday`: `jobPostings[]`/`jobPostings` (depending on tenant) → `title`, `externalPath` or URL built from the host

### Tier 3 — WebSearch queries (BROAD DISCOVERY)

The `search_queries` with `site:` filters cover portals transversally (all Ashby, all Greenhouse, etc.). Useful for discovering NEW companies not yet in `tracked_companies`, but results can be out of date.

**Execution priority:**
1. Tier 1: Playwright → all `tracked_companies` with `careers_url`
2. Tier 2: API → all `tracked_companies` with `api:`
3. Tier 3: WebSearch → all `search_queries` with `enabled: true`

Tiers are additive — all run, results are merged and deduplicated.

## Workflow

1. **Read configuration**: `portals.yml`
2. **Read history**: `data/scan-history.tsv` → URLs already seen
3. **Read dedup sources**: `data/applications.md` + `data/pipeline.md`

4. **Tier 1 — Playwright scan** (parallel in batches of 3-5):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `enabled: true` and `careers_url` defined:
   a. `browser_navigate` to the `careers_url`
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read all job listings
   c. If the page has filters/departments, navigate the relevant sections
   d. For each job listing extract: `{title, url, company}`
   e. If the page paginates results, navigate additional pages
   f. Accumulate into the candidate list
   g. If `careers_url` fails (404, redirect), try `scan_query` as a fallback and flag it to update the URL

5. **Tier 2 — ATS APIs / feeds** (parallel):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `api:` defined and `enabled: true`:
   a. WebFetch the API/feed URL
   b. If `api_provider` is defined, use its parser; if not defined, infer from the domain (`boards-api.greenhouse.io`, `jobs.ashbyhq.com`, `api.lever.co`, `*.bamboohr.com`, `*.teamtailor.com`, `*.myworkdayjobs.com`)
   c. For **Ashby**, send a POST with:
      - `operationName: ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
      - `variables.organizationHostedJobsPageName: {company}`
      - GraphQL query for `jobBoardWithTeams` + `jobPostings { id title locationName employmentType compensationTierSummary }`
   d. For **BambooHR**, the list only carries basic metadata. For each relevant item, read `id`, GET `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`, and extract the full JD from `result.jobOpening`. Use `jobOpeningShareUrl` as the public URL if present; otherwise use the detail URL.
   e. For **Workday**, send a POST JSON with at least `{"appliedFacets":{},"limit":20,"offset":0,"searchText":""}` and paginate by `offset` until results are exhausted
   f. For each job extract and normalize: `{title, url, company}`
   g. Accumulate into the candidate list (dedup against Tier 1)

6. **Tier 3 — WebSearch queries** (parallel if possible):
   For each query in `search_queries` with `enabled: true`:
   a. Run WebSearch with the defined `query`
   b. From each result extract: `{title, url, company}`
      - **title**: from the result title (before " @ " or " | ")
      - **url**: result URL
      - **company**: after " @ " in the title, or extract from the domain/path
   c. Accumulate into the candidate list (dedup against Tier 1+2)

6. **Filter by title** using `title_filter` from `portals.yml`:
   - At least 1 keyword from `positive` must appear in the title (case-insensitive)
   - 0 keywords from `negative` must appear
   - `seniority_boost` keywords give priority but are not required

7. **Deduplicate** against 3 sources:
   - `scan-history.tsv` → exact URL already seen
   - `applications.md` → company + normalized role already evaluated
   - `pipeline.md` → exact URL already in pending or processed

7.5. **Verify liveness of WebSearch results (Tier 3)** — BEFORE adding to pipeline:

   WebSearch results may be out of date (Google caches results for weeks or months). To avoid evaluating expired postings, verify with Playwright every new URL coming from Tier 3. Tiers 1 and 2 are inherently real-time and do not require this verification.

   For each new Tier 3 URL (sequential — NEVER Playwright in parallel):
   a. `browser_navigate` to the URL
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read the content
   c. Classify:
      - **Active**: job title visible + role description + visible Apply/Submit/Solicitar control within the main content. Do not count generic header/navbar/footer text.
      - **Expired** (any of these signals):
        - Final URL contains `?error=true` (Greenhouse redirects this way when the posting is closed)
        - Page contains: "job no longer available" / "no longer open" / "position has been filled" / "this job has expired" / "page not found"
        - Only navbar and footer visible, no JD content (content < ~300 chars)
   d. If expired: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_expired` and discard
   e. If active: continue to step 8

   **Do not interrupt the whole scan if a URL fails.** If `browser_navigate` errors (timeout, 403, etc.), mark as `skipped_expired` and continue to the next.

8. **For each new verified posting that passes filters**:
   a. Add to `pipeline.md` under "Pendientes": `- [ ] {url} | {company} | {title}`
   b. Record in `scan-history.tsv`: `{url}\t{date}\t{query_name}\t{title}\t{company}\tadded`

9. **Postings filtered by title**: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_title`
10. **Duplicate postings**: record with status `skipped_dup`
11. **Expired postings (Tier 3)**: record with status `skipped_expired`

## Extracting title and company from WebSearch results

WebSearch results come in the format: `"Job Title @ Company"` or `"Job Title | Company"` or `"Job Title — Company"`.

Extraction patterns by portal:
- **Ashby**: `"Senior AI PM (Remote) @ EverAI"` → title: `Senior AI PM`, company: `EverAI`
- **Greenhouse**: `"AI Engineer at Anthropic"` → title: `AI Engineer`, company: `Anthropic`
- **Lever**: `"Product Manager - AI @ Temporal"` → title: `Product Manager - AI`, company: `Temporal`

Generic regex: `(.+?)(?:\s*[@|—–-]\s*|\s+at\s+)(.+?)$`

## Private URLs

If a URL is found that is not publicly accessible:
1. Save the JD in `jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md`
2. Add to pipeline.md as: `- [ ] local:jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md | {company} | {title}`

## Scan History

`data/scan-history.tsv` tracks ALL seen URLs:

```
url	first_seen	portal	title	company	status
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	PM AI	Acme	added
https://...	2026-02-10	Greenhouse — SA	Junior Dev	BigCo	skipped_title
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	SA AI	OldCo	skipped_dup
https://...	2026-02-10	WebSearch — AI PM	PM AI	ClosedCo	skipped_expired
```

## Output summary

```
Portal Scan — {YYYY-MM-DD}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Queries run: N
Postings found: N total
Filtered by title: N relevant
Duplicates: N (already evaluated or in pipeline)
Expired discarded: N (dead links, Tier 3)
New added to pipeline.md: N

  + {company} | {title} | {query_name}
  ...

→ Run /trajecktory pipeline to evaluate the new postings.
```

## Push Notification

After printing the summary, send a push notification:

- If new offers found: `"Scan done: {N} new offers — run /trajecktory pipeline to evaluate"`
- If nothing new: `"Scan done: 0 new offers ({N} dupes, {N} expired)"`

Keep it under 120 characters. Use the PushNotification tool with status: "proactive".

## Managing careers_url

Every company in `tracked_companies` should have a `careers_url` — the direct URL to its job postings page. This avoids looking it up every time.

**RULE: Always use the company's corporate URL; fall back to the ATS endpoint only if no native corporate page exists.**

The `careers_url` should point to the company's own careers page whenever it is available. Many companies use Workday, Greenhouse, or Lever under the hood, but they only expose posting IDs through their corporate domain. Using the direct ATS URL when a corporate page exists can cause false 410 errors because the posting IDs do not match.

| ✅ Correct (corporate) | ❌ Wrong as first option (direct ATS) |
|---|---|
| `https://careers.mastercard.com` | `https://mastercard.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com` |
| `https://openai.com/careers` | `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/openai` |
| `https://stripe.com/jobs` | `https://jobs.lever.co/stripe` |

Fallback: if you only have the direct ATS URL, first navigate to the company's website and find its corporate careers page. Only use the direct ATS URL if the company has no native corporate page.

**Known patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}`
- **Greenhouse:** `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}` or `https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/{slug}`
- **Lever:** `https://jobs.lever.co/{slug}`
- **BambooHR:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Teamtailor:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs`
- **Workday:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/{site}`
- **Custom:** The company's own URL (e.g., `https://openai.com/careers`)

**API/feed patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby API:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR API:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail` (`result.jobOpening`)
- **Lever API:** `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor RSS:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday API:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**If `careers_url` does not exist** for a company:
1. Try the known platform pattern
2. If it fails, do a quick WebSearch: `"{company}" careers jobs`
3. Navigate with Playwright to confirm it works
4. **Save the URL found in portals.yml** for future scans

**If `careers_url` returns 404 or redirects:**
1. Note it in the output summary
2. Try scan_query as a fallback
3. Flag for manual update

## Maintaining portals.yml

- **ALWAYS save `careers_url`** when adding a new company
- Add new queries as new portals or interesting roles are discovered
- Disable queries with `enabled: false` if they generate too much noise
- Adjust filtering keywords as target roles evolve
- Add companies to `tracked_companies` when you want to follow them closely
- Verify `careers_url` periodically — companies change ATS platforms
